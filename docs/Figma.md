The challenge
Organisations struggle to implement data driven approach because of:
Limited Technical Expertise  expectations not met, delayed timelines
Poor Data Quality - lack of data ownership, hard to build confidence
Expensive Solutions - licensing and maintenance, restrictions in plans
No Adoption  lack of user-friendliness, no feedback loop
Time consuming - capacity used for repetitive manual tasks
Restrictive tools  lack of flexibility and solutions for enhancements
Not Scalable - known limitations for future needs
